#LuxRender v. 1.5 Release Notes

This version includes vast enhancements to the LuxCore architecture. When using that interface LuxRender can render a scene six times faster than the previous version, when using the CPU.  LuxCore needs to be enabled by the exporter that you use so check with the exporter if it provides support for this feature.

##Installation

###OS X
- Drag the LuxRender folder into the Application folder, as instructed in the DMG file
- If you want to use the command-line tools, included with LuxRender, execute the script `create_systemwide_links` in the LuxRender/interactive_script folder. That will give you access to all the tools, like luxconsole, from the Terminal
- There are some pre-configured scripts that can be used to start useful services, like the node renderer, by simply double-clicking on them from Finder
