pbrt Release 1.03 (24 June 2007)

-------------
Installation:
-------------

The pbrtsrc-1.03.tar.gz and pbrtsrc-1.03.zip files include updated source
code to the pbrt rendering system described in "Physically Based Rendering:
From Theory to Implementation" by Matt Pharr and Greg Humphreys.  The zip
file includes project files, source code, and OpenEXR libraries for bulding
the system under Windows, and the tar.gz file includes makefiles and source
code for building under Linux, OSX, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.  (For these
platforms, you are expected to install OpenEXR on your system yourself;
information about how to do this is provided during the build process.)

See page 1017 of the PBR book for informaton about building and installing
under Windows and page 1018 for information about building and installing
under Linux.  See the pbrt.org website for more information about pbrt.

The source code to pbrt (*but not the contents of the book itself*) is
released under the GNU Public License; see the accompanying file
COPYING.txt for information about the license agreement under which this
software is provided.  Your use of this software constitutes acceptance of
this license.

Thanks in particular to John Danks and Kevin Egan for many bug reports and
patches that went into this release.

--------------------
** Important note **
--------------------

This release includes a fix to bug 45, which leads to different results
being returned from FresnelBlend BSDFs.  In particular, the TT model (and
any other scene that uses this BSDF) will render differently in 1.03 than
it did in 1.02.  However, the 1.03 behavior should match the 1.01
behavior.  (And is believed to finally be fully correct.)

Other Changes:
--------------

This release (like the 1.02 release, though it wasn't mentioned in the
release notes for that release), has the author-supplied plugins from
http://pbrt.org/downloads.php already included.

Bug Fixes: 
----------

The following bugs from the pbrt bug database (http://pbrt.org/bugtracker)
are fixed in this release.

- Bug #77: Fix the Mie scattering phase functions to actually integrate to
one...

- Bug #76: Added missing deletes in ParamSet::Erase*() methods.

- Bug #75: Rewrote ply2pbrt to be in newfangled "ANSI C", not K&R.

- Bug #74: Added calls to let Materials access geometry and material
ParamSets directly.

- Bug #70: The hemisphere check in the Blinn class was incorrect

- Bug #68: The OrenNayar BRDF would return NaNs for certain ill-behaved
  directions.

- Bug #66: Logic in exponent check in Blinn() constructor was incorrect

- Bug #65: May have uninitialized values in LDSampler if an instance is
constructed and then destroyed without any samples being generated.

- Bug #57: Cylindrical texture mapping code had a typo in the discontiuity
detection code where it computes dtdy.

- Bug #56: Partial derivatives of disks are computed incorrectly if the
inner-radius is non-zero.

- Bug #55: The single-scattering volume integrator would crash when there
were no lights

- Bug #54: Change embedded ^M in pbrtlex.l to a more-portable \x0a

- Bug #53: The DirectLighting integrator was incorrectly requesting a
single 2D sample, rather than a single 1D sample, for the case of
choosing a single light source to sample from. 

- Bug #51: Fixed gcc 4.02 build issues.

- Bug #48: Radiance scale factor for transmission into a dielectric was
incorrect.

- Bug #46: TriangleMesh::GetShadingGeometry() wasn't properly transforming
the partial derivatives into world space.

- Bug #45: Fixed incorrect scale factor in FresnelBlend::f() method.

- Bug #44: Invalid ray differentials could be initialized in Scene::
Render() due to that method not paying addention to the weights
returned by Camera::GenerateRay() for the auxiliary rays.

- Bug #43: OSX 10.4 build issues fixed

- Bug #42: NURBS specificed with homogeneous "Pw" coordinates would
incorrectly hit an assertion in the NURBS CreateShape() routine.

- Bug #41: Use safe string functions (snprintf(), etc.) to avoid buffer
  overflows (and make OpenBSD's compiler happier)

- Bug #40: Added support for OpenBSD to makefile and pbrt.h

- Bug #34: Out of bounds sample locations would crash
  ImageFilm::AddSample()

------------------------------
Bug Fixes In The 1.02 Release:
------------------------------

The following bugs were fixed in the previous pbrt patch release.

- Bug #2: Fixed errors in windows project files: film.cpp was missing
from core project, buffer security turned off for release builds, had
project file to build bumpy.cpp (which doesn't exist)
file to build bumpy.cpp was missing.

- Bug #3: Added checks to camera and light constructors to detect
non-uniform scale transformations and warn about them, if present.
(Cameras and lights don't work properly if their transformations have
non-uniform scales)

- Bug #8: Add checks in Blinn and Anisotropic microfacet distribution
constructors to detect excessively large and NaN exponent values.

- Bug #10: Added casts in PhotonIntegrator to eliminate compiler warnings
about casts from doubles.

- Bug #12: Fixed pbrtTransform() to set the current transformation matrix
from the given matrix; previously, it was multiplying by the given matrix,
just like pbrtConcatTransform()

- Bug #13: Input file parser doesn't detect errors like:
 "float foo" "some-texture-name".  (Where "float" should have been
"texture").  This is particularly bad since the TT scene on the CD has this
error in it.  Fixed the parser to detect this case and treat it as a
texture as intended by the user.

- Bug #14: Fixed InfiniteAreaLight::Sample_L() to no longer potentially
divide by an uninitialized variable depending on how the compiler generated
code.  (Also fixed AreaLight in a similar manner).

- Bug #15: Fixed SphericalMapping2D::Map() method to compute *dtdy
correctly (it would incorrectly assign to *dtdx in the else clause of the
if test.)

- Bug #17: Added COREDLL to declaration of ComputeStep1dCDF() function so
that it's available to plugins under windows.

- Bug #18: Fixed triangle area calculation in test for degenerate uv
mapping on triangles in TriangleMesh's CreateShape() function.

- Bug #20: Avoid possible degenerate case when computing dPdu and dPdv on
spheres.

- Bug #21: Fix Assert() macro to handle expressions using modulus '%'
operator.

- Bug #25: Fix error in implementation of Anisotropic::sampleFirstQuadrant()

- Bug #26: dNdu and dNdv in DifferentialGeometry should be Normals (and in
particular should transform like Normals), not Vectors.

- Bug #27: Fix AggregateVolume::p() method to correctly handle the case of
multiple overlapping volumes.

- Bug #28: Fixed Scene::WorldBound() to include the extents of any
VolumeRegions in the scene as well as the scene geometry.

- Bug #29: Fixed the Monte Carlo-based implementation of BxDF::rho() to no
longer incorrectly divide by M_PI.

- Bug #30: Fixed the computation of blinn_pdf value in Blinn microfacet
distribution to divide by exponent+2, not exponent+1.

- Bug #32: Use $(MAKE), not "make" in clean rule in makefile.

- Bug #33: Fixed implementation of Anisotropic::D() and anisotropic_pdf
calculations to match derivation.

- Bug #36: Fixed possible dereference of NULL pointer when per-vertex
tangents were provided for triangle mesh without per-vertex normals.

- Bug #37: Fixed LookAt implementation so that it actually will always
generate a rigid body transformation.

-------------------------------------
Additional fixes without bug numbers:
-------------------------------------

Turned off buffer security checks on windows builds; this speeds things up
a bunch!

Added missing COREDLL declarations to: Spectrum::Exp(),
RejectionSampleDisk(), Rotate[XYZ](), Rotate(), LookAt(), EstimateDirect(),
SampleStep1d(), ComputeStep1dCDF(), MemoryArena class, GeometricPrimitive
class, and InstancePrimitive class.

Added missing const qualifier to Point::operator+ method.

Fixed BBox::BoundingSphere() method to handle degenerate bounding boxes
gracefully.

Fixed typo in MipMap down-filtering of previous mip-map level.

Fixed DirectLighting integrator so that area light sources visible from
specular reflection or refraction would still be visible.

Fixed AreaLight::Sample_L() method to pass the sampled point to
AreaLight::L() to compute outgoing radiance, not the point at which
lighting is being computed.

Fixed memory leaks in LDSampler by freeing memory in destructor.

Fix TriangleMesh computation of bitangent vectors in cases where tangent
vectors are provided explicitly.

Fixed case in ImageFilm that could lead to images with zero pixels in one
dimension when a small crop window was given.

Added 2005 to copyright notices.

Bumped version number to 1.02.
